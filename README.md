# Simple-Password-Generator

This program generates a random password with a specified length and an option to add additional characters. It uses the C++ standard library's random number generation functions and user input validation to ensure the generated password is of the correct length and contains only valid characters. The program prompts the user to specify the desired password length and whether or not to add additional characters. It then generates a password using a set of alphanumeric characters and optionally adds additional symbols. The generated password is displayed on the console.
